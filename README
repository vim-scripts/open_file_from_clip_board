Note this script need clipboard supported 

http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Accessing_the_system_clipboard

specifically, it use the * register to get the text in the clipboard

this little script define a function call OpenFilesFromClipboard()

If you, for example, execute some command from the terminal (maybe a grep) and get result like this:

/Users/me/myfile:23:something something
/Users/me/anotherfile: 34 I am a file
/Users/me/yetanotherone hello

what you can do with this plugin is: highlight the text and copy it into your system clipboard (Cmd-c in MacOSX and Ctrl-c in Windows)

Assuming you have a mapping in your .vimrc
map <LEADER>jc :call OpenFilesFromClipboard()

then open your vim and type <LEADER>jc will open that each file into a new tab
I hard code to tabnew for now, check back later version for more flexibility

Note:
 just reallize that support different program on different environment is impossible. If it works for you, great, otherwise, please read the code, the idea and code it up for your usage
